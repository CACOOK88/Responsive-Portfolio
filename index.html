                        <h4>Hello World!</h4> 
                        
                        My name is Chad Cook and I am a refrigerated trailer Rental Manager in Charlotte, North Carolina. I decided to take my life to the next level with UNCC's Full Stack Web Development Certificate. Graduating from this program will be one of my greatest accomplishments. During my time in the program, I plan to use the knowledge and technologies learned to acquire freelance website projects before finding full-time employment. At the conclusion of week 1 I have acquired a commitment to a website project for a local tree trimming and removal service. 
                        <br><br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy soccer practices and games with my 11 year old son, Ryan. We also like to explore trails on our mountain bikes as well as visit state parks. When Ryan is not around I love to take my motorcycle on a scenic ride through the NC mountains and the Blue Ridge Parkway. As a family we love to take the 4runner on the off-road trails of Uwharrie or out onto the beaches at Fort Fisher.
